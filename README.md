clean-timber
============

This is a clean [shopify](http://www.shopify.com/) theme based on [timber v1.3.2](https://github.com/Shopify/Timber) with a small [grunt file](https://github.com/the-working-party/shopify-grunt-tools) that handles all assets.

To run it, install the dependencies via:

```shell
	npm install
```

```shell
	grunt
